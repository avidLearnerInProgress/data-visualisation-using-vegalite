# Ambulance Callout Data Visualization Using Tableau

Following tasks are performed on the Callout Data
1. Which station (e.g. Donnybrook) had the most call outs?

2. How does the number of ambulance call outs vary across the day? Is the pattern consistent across the three years?

3. How does the average waiting time (MinutesToArrival) vary throughout the day?

4. Which ‘Clinical Status’ type is associated with the longest and shortest average waiting time?

5. How has the average waiting time for each ‘Clinical Status’ type changed between 2013 and 2015?

6. Which station is associated with the highest and lowest median waiting times? Is this consistent across the three years?

7. Which days of the week have the highest number of call outs?
